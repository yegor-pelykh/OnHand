# OnHand

I present to you my browser extension, created for easy and convenient management of your favorite sites, which can be opened directly from a browser "new tab" page.

Neat and minimalistic.
Uses material design.

Features:
- adding bookmarks in a simple way
- grouping bookmarks using tabs
- easy data management, loading and saving to a file, without clouds and accounts
- supports switching between light and dark theme (it depends on the theme color of the operating system)
- can be run in any browser that supports WebExtension API, such as:
  * Google Chrome
  * Opera
  * Firefox
  * Edge
  * Chromium
  * etc.

Currently, there are such restrictions on the use of this add-on:
- only English interface language is supported
- this addon was made only for desktop browsers

## Usage Notes

Just a few words about opening added bookmarks. ðŸ˜‰

By **clicking on a bookmark**, the website will be opened **in the same tab** by default.<br>
But when you **hold down the Ctrl key**, the browser will open the website **in a new background tab**.
